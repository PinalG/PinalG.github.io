                <h4>Welcome to my portfolio!</h4>
                <p>Building AI Systems That Work in the Real World</p> 
                <p>I’m an AI Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience designing and deploying production-grade, user-facing AI systems that combine agentic workflows, robust data engineering, and scalable backend platforms. My work focuses on turning ambiguous problems into reliable AI solutions—whether that’s orchestrating LLM-powered agents, building multimodal systems, or optimizing performance and engagement in real products.</p>
                <p>I’ve built and shipped AI systems across startup and nonprofit environments, delivering measurable impact including 40% accuracy improvements, 22% latency reduction, and 18–31% engagement lift. My background in data engineering and experimentation shapes how I approach AI: with strong context pipelines, evaluation, and an emphasis on systems that hold up beyond demos.</p>
                <p>I hold a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence and bring hands-on experience across LLMs, multimodal AI (text, image, voice), Python/SQL pipelines, FastAPI backends, and cloud platforms (GCP/Firebase). I’m motivated by problems where AI directly improves decision-making, efficiency, and user experience—especially in domains like healthcare, sustainability, and applied AI products.</p>
                <p>If you’re interested in building AI systems that are practical, scalable, and built to last, let’s connect.</p>

                    <h4>My Journey in Artificial Intelligence</h4>
                    <p>My interest in programming started early, when I began building simple applications in Java and C during high school. What began as curiosity quickly turned into a drive to understand how software and data can be used to solve real problems, leading me to pursue a career in IT.</p>
                    <p>Through hands-on projects, self-study, and formal training, I developed a strong foundation in Python, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Over time, my focus shifted toward building production-ready AI systems, including predictive models, deep learning applications, and AI-driven workflows designed for real-world use.</p>
                    <p>This portfolio reflects that progression showcasing practical projects, applied experience, and a commitment to continuous learning as AI technologies evolve. My goal is to build systems that are not only technically sound, but also deliver meaningful, measurable impact.</p>
